                <p>
                  Wantulla showed that BSF frass and exuviae only suppressed
                  <em>Delia radicum</em> when they primed resident
                  <em>Pseudomonas</em> communities; efficacy and larval mortality
                  were soil-type specific yet achieved without compromising
                  cabbage biomass.

                <p>
                  Green et al. found winter wheat shoots were 11% taller and
                  heavier after frass drenches even though the material contained
                  only trace N:P:K. Enterococcus species were traced from larval
                  guts into the rhizosphere as the likely plant-growth trigger.

                  Treating greenhouse maize with BSF frass boosted grain yield
                  by 2–25% over NPK or brewer’s grain compost and raised net
                  income 163% when frass was paired 50:50 with mineral N.

                <p>
                  Beesigamukama et al. reported that 7.5 t/ha of BSF frass
                  produced 14% more maize grain than a commercial organic
                  fertiliser and 7% more than urea, while increasing N uptake by
                  76% and doubling agronomic N-use efficiency.

                  for ryegrass production, increased nitrate and dissolved N, and
                  did not elevate coliform counts after soil incorporation.

                  Fuhrmann et al. tracked Rwandan grass–clover pots and saw
                  BSF residues lift plant yield 17% and basal respiration 16%

                  <em>Dodonaea</em> height growth and kept survival at 95%,
                  whereas NPK cut survival to 5%; overdosing (2× rate) was lethal,

                  Kavanagh et al. evaluated six monoecious and dioecious hemp
                  cultivars and found low HexaFrass™ doses (3 g/pot) increased
                  shoot growth in both male and female plants with no marginal
                  gains at higher rates, mirroring other organic fertilisers.

                &mdash; Three British Columbia trials found 5 t/ha of frass
                delivered commercial bok choi, lettuce, and potato yields while
                5–8% (dw/dw) starter mixes outperformed worm castings and hinted
